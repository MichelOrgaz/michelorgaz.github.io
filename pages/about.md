Hello, I'm a 30' french web developper.
My main goal is to produce cool stuff by working again after my day job. I also want to improve my skills and be a better person.

I spent a lot of my hobby time making "indie" video games, using Game Maker and Unity, and drawings. Now I concentrate on web development.

So many things in the world are interesting... and I have not enough time. Experience of programming is a really good deal to catch many of them. Let's go!
