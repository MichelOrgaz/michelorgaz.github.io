I made this sequel immediately after I released the first one. The game is also made with Game Maker (4 months of work), fixes issues and adds a lot of new features.

All resources are made by myself, code, sprites, animations, texts, except few one, made by Freya Infel.
Musics has been created by Duane Zuwala from the band *The Adventures of Duane and BrandO*.

##Story
New stuff: local coop mode, 3 levels of difficulty, 50 levels, bonus mode, punch and kick abilities, etc.
Duane and Mitch must beat 5 different worlds and bosses to save the world from zombie clones.
