**Action Adventure World The Game** is a small "indie" PC game I made in 2011 july with Game Maker. I spent 4 month making code, sprites, animations, levels, ideas... Musics and quotes has been produced by Duane Zuwala, singer from the band *The Adventures of Duane and BrandO*. 

##About
The game is a classic speedrun platformer with 28 levels to go through.
**Duane Zuwala** is the main character of the game. He must deactivate bomb at the end of each levels and finally defeat the bad guy.
